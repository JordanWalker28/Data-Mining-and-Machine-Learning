To use weka via the python wrapper on the command line. You must install the packages in requirements.txt, either to the root python environment or a python virtual environemnt. Note: you must have a java8 installed to use the weka command line wrapper. Only java 8 seemed to work for me.

To create and install a virtual environment:

virtualenv weka_env

source weka_env/bin/activate

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Examples on how to use the python3 weka wrapper are here: https://fracpete.github.io/python-weka-wrapper/examples.html
